  This is a proof of concept for an employee directory more than a useable app. To make this useable, there would need to be the entire backend built, with api calls in the client. I need to add the functionality to add, delete, update, and create contacts. I would also have to add a user schema to keep contacts specific to one user. Lastly, I would need to create and connect to a database. That would complete the full-stack.
